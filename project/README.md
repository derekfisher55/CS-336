CS 336: Project Proposal

For my final project I am interested in working on the Museum Holdings project.
From the description: "Professor VanAntwerpâ€™s father works with the Pine River
Area Historical Society and with their museum in Tustin, Michigan. They
would like a catalog of holdings. Visitors to the museum could point
to a QR code and get a short explanation of the object, its significance,
links to other similar objects in the museum, and (perhaps) external
links/documentation." I am interested in deploying this type of application and
would like to work on a real-world project.
