Lab 11 Questions:

a)  Compare and contrast your development and production deployments
    and explain how each is designed.
    The production deployment adds a few plugins that increase the efficiency
    of the server. For example I added, UglifyJsPlugin which helps increase the
    speed of loading JavaScript by compressing and minifying the code. The
    production deployment also removes the dev server as it shouldn't be needed
    in a production deployment.

b)  List the optimizations youâ€™ve configured for this production version and,
    if possible, find evidence of then in the deployed application files.
    As mentioned before, we added UglifyJsPlugin which you can see in the web-pack
    that the JavaScript has changed to the "ugly" version. We also added the
    OccurenceOrderPlugin which according to the website, "With this plugin,
    Webpack will analyze and prioritize often used modules assigning them the smallest ids."
