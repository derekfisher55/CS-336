Lab 10 Questions:

a)  Compare and contrast MongoDB and the SQL databases you’ve used before.
    Are there things that one can do that the other can’t?
    With the MongoDB database, it is easier to actually see the database.
    You can see the files and how it works more than SQL. That's probably due to
    how MLab works, but its easier to work with.

b)  You could run MongoDB locally. What advantages and/or disadvantages would
    that bring with respect to the cloud database you have now?
    It would be an instant connection, rather than relying on the internet
    connection. A disadvantage would be the storage space that it would take up.
    This would be important as the database gets bigger.

c)  You’ve built a “sandbox” database on mLab. Could you use this for a
    production database? Why or why not?
    I don't think so. It doesn't seem very powerful which you would need for a
    production quality server.

a)  For this integration of mLab into your application, was it better to run
    the modified server (npm start) or the full Webpack development environment
    (npm run dev)? Why?
    It was better for debugging to run in dev mode. I had a hard time getting it
    to run and the error messages aren't very helpful when you simply npm start.

b)  Explain what happens when you modify the database using mLab’s web interface
    rather than your application? Try adding/updating/deleting comment documents.
    Well the application is pushing for new comments every couple of seconds so
    it is able to reflect those changes pretty quickly.

c)  Is this comments application the sort of application that should use an SQL
    or a noSQL database? Explain your answer.
    I think that noSQL work so that the user doesn't have to push the data to some
    json file, but cna have a central place where all the comments are kept.
