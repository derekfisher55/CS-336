Identify the request methods that you can and can’t test using the two tools listed above.
If a method cannot be testing using a particular tool, explain why this is the case.
List the Curl commands you used successfully.

  - You can only see the GET method using the dev tools, unless you use your form to send a POST request.
    This is because the browser is really only designed to GET data rather than the other methods.
  - Using curl, you can GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, HEAD.
  - I was able to use:
      curl -X GET localhost:3000/request
      curl -X POST localhost:3000/request -d {arg:"Hello!"} -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
      curl localhost:3000/request -I
      curl -X PUT localhost:3000/request -d {arg:"Hello"} -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

What is the most appropriate HTTP response code for pages that aren’t defined by an Express route?

  - the default 404 not found error.

What HTTP methods do forms support?

  - forms only support the GET and POST methods.

How is the form data being passed back to the server and what syntactic form does it take?
Is the data modified in any way?

  - The data looks like so:
      user_name=Bill+Gates&user_mail=billy_g%40hotmail.com&user_message=Hello+World%21

  - The server receives a string that will be parsed in order to get the data as a list of key/value pairs.
    The way you access this list depends on the development platform you use and on any specific frameworks you may be using with it.
    The technology you use also determines how duplicate keys are handled; often,
    the most recently received value for a given key is given priority.
